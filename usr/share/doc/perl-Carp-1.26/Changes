version 1.26; 2012-06-18

  * bugfix: get ", <fh> line 123" phrase from CORE::die, not allowing
    influence by any CORE::GLOBAL::die override, so that Carp can be
    used as part of a CORE::GLOBAL::die override

  * on VMS, skip some tests that rely on open3() which doesn't work
    there yet

version 1.25; 2012-02-16

  * bugfix: avoid failure to export to very old (Perl 5.6) versions of
    warnings.pm, which could occur due to circular dependency

  * bugfix: avoid vivifying "utf8" stash on Perl 5.6, which caused swash
    loading to fail in some situations

  * add dot to end of message from Carp, to match the formatting from
    CORE::die

  * synch Carp::Heavy version number to Carp

version 1.24; 2012-02-02

  * bugfix: make Carp::Heavy load Carp, as it used to prior to 1.22,
    for backward compatibility

  * avoid " in Carp.t test programs, which caused false failures on
    Win32 due to faulty system()

version 1.22; 2011-09-04
