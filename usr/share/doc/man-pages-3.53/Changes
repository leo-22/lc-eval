Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

clock_nanosleep.2
futex.2
nanosleep.2
poll.2
sigaction.2
sigreturn.2
signal.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add restart_syscall(2)

open.2
    Michael Kerrisk [Geoffrey Thomas]
        Remove warning that O_DIRECTORY is only for use with opendir(3)
            O_DIRECTORY can also be used with, for example, O_PATH.

perf_event_open.2
    Vince Weaver
        Improve PERF_SAMPLE_BRANCH_STACK documentation
    Vince Weaver
        Fix indentation of the MMAP layout section
            The indentation of the MMAP layout section wasn't quite right.
            I think this improves things but I admit I'm not an expert at the
            low-level indentation directives.
    Vince Weaver
        Update PERF_IOC_FLAG_GROUP info
            It turns out PERF_IOC_FLAG_GROUP was broken from 75f937f24bd9
            (in Linux 2.6.31, the initial perf_event release) until
            724b6daa1 (Linux 3.4).

            I've done some extensive kernel source code digging plus
            running tests of various kernels and I hope the info
            presented is accurate now.

            (Patch edited somewhat by mtk.)
    Vince Weaver
        Improve sysfs files documentation
            This improves the documentation of the various
            perf_event_open()-related sysfs files.

ptrace.2
    Denys Vlasenko  [Oleg Nesterov, Dmitry V. Levin]
        If SEIZE was used, initial auto-attach stop is EVENT_STOP
            For every PTRACE_O_TRACEfoo option, mention that old-style SIGSTOP
            is replaced by PTRACE_EVENT_STOP if PTRACE_SEIZE attach was used.

            Mention the same thing again in the description of
            PTRACE_EVENT_STOP.
    Denys Vlasenko  [Oleg Nesterov, Dmitry V. Levin]
        Mention that PTRACE_PEEK* libc API and kernel API are different
    Denys Vlasenko  [Oleg Nesterov, Dmitry V. Levin]
        Clarify PTRACE_INTERRUPT, PTRACE_LISTEN, and group-stop behavior

readlink.2
    Chuck Coffing
        Fix possible race condition in readlink.2 example
            I noticed that the example in the readlink.2 man pages does error
            checking for a race condition that would cause the value of the
            symbolic link to get larger.  However, it doesn't handle the
            opposite case, in which the value gets shorter.  (The NULL
            terminator is always set at the old, longer offset.)  This could
            cause the program to operate on uninitialized data.
