==================== Changes in man-pages-posix-2003-a ====================

Released: 2008-06-12

Global changes
--------------

This package was created by splitting out the POSIX pages
(sections 0p, 1p, 3p) from the man-pages package.  (man-pages-2.80
was the last man-pages release to include the POSIX pages.)
These are pages from POSIX.1-2001, Technical Corrigendum 1.
Since TC1 appeared in 2003, it is also known as POSIX.1-2003.
